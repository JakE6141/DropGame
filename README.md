I created a simple game by following documentation. I added my own spin to make it competitive, incorporating a scoring system and additional challenges. I wanted to get started with Lib GDX so I followed documentaiton
and took what I learned to build onto the game to create my own vision of it. 
# Game Overview #
My game is a simple 2D game where players control a bucket to dodge falling meteors while trying to catch droplets of water to score points.  The objective is to reach a score of 10 points.
At that point you can either play again or exit the game after getting the "Winner" message. When you lose you are prompted to click on the screen to try again.

# Features #
* ### Character Control: You can either control the bucket with the arrow keys or you can click and hold to drag the button around. It goes only left and right.
* ### Scoring System: Every time you catch a raindrop your score increases by one. When you are hit with a meteor you score decreses by one. Get to ten points to win, when your score is zero you lose and can restart.
* ### Competitve Twist: One of the other changes I made was making the game more like a competitve game. I wanted there to be some sort of barrier to win. So I added in meteors. I made the meteors spawn more frequently than the raindrops to make sure it was realitivley harder to win.
